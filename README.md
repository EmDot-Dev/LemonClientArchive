# LemonClient_VRC

THIS NO LONGER WORKS, AFTER VRCHAT IMPLEMENTED EAC. THIS HAS BECOME AN ARCHIVE FOR MY WORK

As I am constantly working on and updating this project, the release may not always be up to date. I will do my best, but if a few days pass without an updated release, pleaase refer to the _LemonClient.dll file in the directory _LemonClient/bin/Debug/_LemonClient.dll. This will be the most up to date version, HOWEVER, it will contain untested & random code that may or may not end up in the final released versions.

A simple VRChat modification to the client, to add custom features to the capability of the client
